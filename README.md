### Hi! <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/santilococo/santilococo/main/wave.gif" width="30px">

My name is Santiago. I am a software engineering student at ITBA (Instituto Tecnológico de Buenos Aires). I am an active learner and I am very curious to discover new things. I think curiosity is precisely what drives me to keep learning new things. I love creating new projects. 

You can find me on [Linkedin][1] and on my university-related [Github][2] account.
